# Arrayish - an Array subclass

## About

A challenge to myself to create a usable and useful Array subclass, extending some methods and improving others.
For example, adding/extending functions from [arr by lukeed](https://github.com/lukeed/arr). Also adding simple static functions that I have found handy over the years.

Uses:

-   Microbundle (pre-configured bundler)
-   Husky (formatting on commit)
-   Prettier (formatting)
-   arr
